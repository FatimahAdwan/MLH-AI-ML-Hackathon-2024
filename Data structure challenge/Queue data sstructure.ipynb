    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "In many real-world applications, managing tasks or processes in an orderly and efficient manner is crucial. A common challenge is to ensure that tasks are processed in the order they are received, without skipping or delaying any tasks unnecessarily. This project addresses the need to design a simple, yet effective task management system that processes tasks on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis. The system will implement a queue data structure to manage the task flow, ensuring that each task is handled in the correct sequence, demonstrating the practical application of queues in managing real-time operations and tasks.\n",
    "## Aim and Objectives:\n",
    "The aim of this project is to provide a practical understanding of the queue data structure by implementing it in Python and applying it to manage tasks in a real-world scenario. The objectives include solidifying core data structure concepts, enhancing programming skills through hands-on coding, and demonstrating the application of queues in solving everyday programming challenges, ultimately preparing the learner for more advanced studies in data structures and algorithms."
